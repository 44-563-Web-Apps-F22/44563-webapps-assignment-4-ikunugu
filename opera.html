    <h4>H.M.S PINAFORE</h4>
    <h6>ACT I.—Noon</h6>
    <p style="color:green">SCENE—Quarter-deck of H.M.S. Pinafore. Sailors, led by BOATSWAIN,
        discovered cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">Enter LITTLE BUTTERCUP, with large basket on her arm</p>
    <p><b>CAPT.</b> My child, I grieve to see that you are a prey to melancholy. You
        should look your best to-day, for Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., will
        be here this afternoon to claim your promised hand. <br>
        <b>JOS.</b> Ah, father, your words cut me to the quick. I can esteem—
        reverence—venerate Sir Joseph, for he is a great and good man;
        but oh, I
        cannot love him! My heart is already given.<br>
        <b>CAPT.</b> (aside). It is then as I feared. (Aloud.) Given? And to
        whom? Not
        to some gilded lordling?<br>
        <b>JOS.</b> No, father—the object of my love is no lordling. Oh, pity me, for
        he is but a humble sailor on board your own ship!<br>
        <b>CAPT.</b> Impossible!<br>
        <b>JOS.</b>Yes, it is true.<br>
        <b>CAPT.</b> A common sailor? Oh fie!<br>
        <b>JOS.</b> I blush for the weakness that allows me to cherish such a
        passion.
        I hate myself when I think of the depth to which I have stooped
        in
        permitting myself to think tenderly of one so ignobly born, but I
        love
        him! I love him! I love him! (Weeps.)<br>
        <b>CAPT.</b> Come, my child, let us talk this over. In a matter of the
        heart I would not coerce my daughter—I attach but little value to rank
        or wealth, but the line must be drawn somewhere. A man in that station may
        be brave and worthy, but at every step he would commit solecisms
        that society would never pardon.<br>
        <b>JOS.</b> Oh, I have thought of this night and day. But fear not,
        father, I
        have a heart, and therefore I love; but I am your daughter, and
        therefore
        I am proud. Though I carry my love with me to the tomb, he shall
        never,
        never know it.<br>
        <b>CAPT.</b> You are my daughter after all. But see, Sir Joseph's
        barge approaches, manned by twelve trusty oarsmen and accompanied by
        the admiring crowd of sisters, cousins, and aunts that attend him
        wherever he goes. Retire, my daughter, to your cabin—take this, his
        photograph, with you—it may help to bring you to a more reasonable frame of mind.<br>
        <b>JOS.</b> My own thoughtful father!</p>
